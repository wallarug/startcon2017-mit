# README #

This repository is for all the software that is being developed to make the MIT RACECARs operational for StartCon.  There are a number of branches:

* **master**: the branch that will be cloned onto each Jetson once we are finished
* **rp-lidar**: development branch for researching the abilities of the RP-LIDAR.  This can be used for test scripts, research and other activities relating to this system.  Since the RP-LIDAR has not been throughly researched yet, this branch will include discoveries and other tips and tricks for the RP LIDAR.
* **web-dev**: development branch for building the web portal and other ROS integration features.  Display ZED stream, swap between different controls, etc.
* **vision-control**: development branch for building vision sensors, ROS packages and other OpenCV image analysis tools.
* **lidar-control**: development branch for building lidar control systems.  This includes SLAM, obstacle avoidance, etc.
