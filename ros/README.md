# To run the car
```
# run car + camera
roslaunch the_robotics_club mit-car.launch

# run car + camera + lidar + hectorslam
roslaunch the_robotics_club mit-car-lidar.launch
# then on a remote ubuntu machine run
roslaunch the_robotics_club mit-car-lidar-observer.launch

# run car + camera + cv
roslaunch the_robotics_club mit-car-vision.launch
```

# Using the Computer Vision launcher
The joystick is used as safety for now. 
Top left trigger: as is previously, used for manual control.
Top right trigger: activates driving based computer vision & PID


# To observe the camera remotely with rqt_gui
```
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://x.x.x.x:11311 the_robotics_club observer.launch
```



# How to watch the GPU memory usage
looks like the Zed uses about 1850/7850MB just being in the desktop with a few terminals and gedit running
```
sudo ~/tegrastats
```
